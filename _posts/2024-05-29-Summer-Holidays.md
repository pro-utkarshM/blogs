> Day 01

It's 23:30 May 29, 2024, And I got this rediculas Idea to write everyday as I am having a summer break after my fourth semester exams got ended.
Speaking of now I am listening to Harry Potter and the Philosphers Stone Audio book currently on chapter 10, I am doing this now and then. 

I am looking forward to this month from the start of this year, reasons are not to be released now.
