Well I am resuming this on 1:25 am, June 1, 2024. I am very very dumb to resume writing this, I expect no one to read this but if you are its ok. Well from today I'll be doing projects I like and trying not to jump on any projects that lore me (I abandon projects like they are my children), well from today these projects will be my atmost priority.

### Projects to be done:
1. Compiler
2. Linux kernel Drivers
3. LFS files
4. X-Downloader
5. ComConnect
6. myOwnOS
7. Kernel Carnival
8. Chess Engine Rust
9. Project-X
10. Professional Network Design

### Books to Complete
1. The art of Hacking
2. Robert Love
3. Linux Kernel Primer
4. Art of linux Kernel Design
5. The Hard things of the Hard things


Well after writing all this, I feel weighed down by the projects to be done in this month, well I'll be writing every day for a month to you know to feel "accountable".
