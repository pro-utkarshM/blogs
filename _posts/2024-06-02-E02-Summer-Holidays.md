Hello there, I lived another day to tell tales of how horrible my days are going in my university. Well yesterday I did make an ADO in rust, well that contains more bugs than I could solve in a day, so today I will resume that again.

Today I will be doing:
- VLANs / Virtual Networks
- myOwnOS
- Linux Kernel Notes

Well I hope today I will cover 10 chapters from Harry Potter Chambers of Secret.
Will update if I'll have nothing to do!

Signing off.
