Hello there, today I did nothing? I cannot remember now but I did attended 4 meetings regarding future projects... made a software dev resume, last resume was for kernel developer... 

Today I will be doing:
- VLANs / Virtual Networks
- myOwnOS
- Hackathon Project
- Linux Kernel Notes

Well I hope today I will cover 10 chapters from Harry Potter Chambers of Secret.
Will update if I'll have nothing to do!

Signing off.
