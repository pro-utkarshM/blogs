Hello everyone, I am here again doing this regreting over my life choices(oh I have nothing good to do :D), listening to Harry Potter Book 2 E12, I read some case study from "Distributed Operating System" for my future project. 

I woke up at 5pm, I was mad at me but from today I will sleep before 12 today.

Signing off.
