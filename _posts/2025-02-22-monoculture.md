Yesterday, I was having a long conversation with my mom—one of those rare, deep talks about ideologies, how the world works, and, more importantly, how it *should* work. We talked for 45 minutes straight, and honestly, I really admire how she thinks. It was a great discussion, just bouncing ideas off each other.    

Then, out of nowhere, she goes, *“You should read psychology.”*  

I was like, *Mamma, I don’t even have time for this* (not saying no, just being realistic). After some more back-and-forth, I convinced her that I’m already overly committed and can’t dedicate time to this right now. She understood but still told me, *“Read whenever you get time.”*   

Fast forward two days—I was searching for a screw in my upper almirah rack (that place is basically a book graveyard, around 20 books buried under layers of dust). I found one with a cover on it, had no clue what it was. Curiosity kicked in, so I pulled it out. Turns out, it was *101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think.*  

And now here I am, writing about it because, obviously, I let myself read the first essay: *"Subconscious Behaviors That Are Keeping You From Having The Life You Want."*  

It started with this idea—every generation has a *monoculture*. No clue what that meant. Turns out, it's a collective belief, a kind of shared reassurance people follow without questioning.    

And that got me thinking.  

Am I also built by this monoculture? Is that a good thing? A bad thing? And does it even matter? But wait—*I* take pride in calling myself curious, someone who believes in first-principles thinking. How the hell am I following something I don’t even fully understand? That realization hit hard.  

I have a week now to sit with this thought, figure it out. (Technically, mid-sems are here, which means I have all the time in the world.) Will update soon.
