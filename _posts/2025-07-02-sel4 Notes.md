## First, What the Hell is seL4?

So here‚Äôs the elevator pitch:

> **seL4 is a microkernel that's so small, so secure, and so deterministic, you could literally use it to fly a drone, run a pacemaker, or control a satellite‚Äîwith mathematical proof that it won‚Äôt screw up.**

It‚Äôs not your average Linux or Windows-style kernel. It‚Äôs **minimalist**, **formal-verification-friendly**, and **capability-based**. That last one is key‚Äîmore on that soon.

---

## Big Picture: How Most Kernels Work

Traditional kernels like Linux or Windows? They're **monolithic**:

* **Big** codebase (millions of lines).
* Everything runs in kernel space: scheduler, drivers, filesystem, network stack.
* If any part crashes or misbehaves, your whole system is toast.

They prioritize performance and features. But they sacrifice **isolation** and **guarantees**.

Now think about it‚Äîif you're building a critical system (nuclear reactor? medical robot?), you **can‚Äôt afford** uncertainty or bugs. That‚Äôs where seL4 walks in.

---

## Enter seL4: The Hardcore Minimalist

### Microkernel Philosophy

* seL4 strips the kernel **down to the bare minimum**:

  * Scheduling
  * IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
  * Virtual memory
  * Capability system
* Everything else? **User space.** Filesystems, device drivers, networking‚Äîall pushed out.

If it‚Äôs not about **safe and fast resource management**, it doesn‚Äôt belong in seL4.

### Capabilities Instead of Permissions

Here's where it gets spicy.

In Linux, processes ask the kernel:
‚ÄúCan I read `/etc/passwd`? Can I send a signal to PID 1234?‚Äù

seL4 flips the model:

> ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt *ask* permission. You either **have the capability**, or you don‚Äôt even know the resource exists.‚Äù

Capabilities are **unforgeable references** to kernel objects (like threads, memory, endpoints). If your process doesn‚Äôt have a capability, it's like the thing literally doesn‚Äôt exist. Perfect for security isolation.

---

## Formal Verification: Bug-Proof by Math

Here‚Äôs the biggest flex:

> seL4 is the **first ever OS kernel that's been mathematically proven to be correct.**

Yeah. Like... they wrote math proofs that say:
1. This pointer will never be NULL.
2. This buffer will never overflow.
3. This syscall will always behave as defined.

Compare that to Linux:
"Well, if it crashes, we‚Äôll patch it next week."

seL4 is more like:

> "We know it can‚Äôt crash‚Äîbecause **theorems**."

---

## How seL4 Works: Startup to Runtime

Let‚Äôs imagine the system boots:

1. **Bootloader** hands off control to `init_kernel()`.
2. Kernel sets up:

   * Kernel page tables
   * Memory regions
   * IRQs
   * Capability space (CNode)
3. It creates the **root thread** with a small set of **initial capabilities** (like memory, IPC endpoints).
4. After that, the kernel is basically hands-off.

   * All system management (creating threads, mapping memory) happens in **userspace**, using system calls gated by capabilities.

It's like the kernel is a **hyper-paranoid concierge**:

> "You can only do what you‚Äôve been explicitly allowed to. And I‚Äôm not gonna help unless you show me a valid keycard (capability)."

## What's Different vs Linux / Windows?

| Feature        | seL4                                      | Linux / Windows                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Kernel Type    | Microkernel                               | Monolithic                        |
| Security       | Capability-based (zero ambient authority) | Permissions model (UID/GID, ACLs) |
| Verification   | Formally verified                         | No formal proofs                  |
| Size           | \~10K LOC                                 | 20M+ LOC                          |
| Failure Domain | Small (isolated apps)                     | Whole system crash risk           |
| Performance    | Near-native (crazy optimized IPC)         | High, but risk of bugs            |
| Dev Model      | Minimal TCB, build everything yourself    | Batteries included (with bugs)    |

## Real Talk: Why Would You Use seL4?

If you‚Äôre building a:

* **Medical device**
* **Spacecraft**
* **Secure smartphone**
* **Military drone**
* **Blockchain hardware wallet**

‚Ä¶and you need to **prove** your OS won‚Äôt panic, leak memory, or let malware sneak in?

You use **seL4**.

But if you're building a web server or gaming laptop? Stick with Linux‚ÄîseL4 is not here to replace your desktop OS (yet).

---

## TL;DR Like You‚Äôre 5

* Most OSes are big janky castles with guards at the gates.
* seL4 is a tiny, hyper-disciplined vault that says:

  > ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only open this drawer **if you show me the exact key**, and I‚Äôll mathematically prove I‚Äôll never open the wrong one.‚Äù

It‚Äôs **clean**, **correct**, **secure**, and **scary-smart**.

---

### Now why the hell i am doing this, well because i am upto something thats true, we (someone and i) are trying to build something crazyy :D

## TL;DR: For MicroBPF (now hypOS) ‚Äî start with **seL4** as your base. Don‚Äôt reinvent the kernel. Yet.

Building the BPF execution + syscall plumbing on top. Focus your genius where it matters.

---

### What's MicroBPF (now hypOS) Trying to Do Again?

You're building:

* A **secure** unikernel-like OS for **embedded or IoT**.
* Runs custom apps / BPF logic in an isolated, sandboxed way.
* Uses **eBPF** to plug in logic without modifying the core system.
* Probably aims for **real-time**, **deterministic**, **tamper-proof** execution.

---

## Option A: **Use seL4 as Base**

**Why it's üî• for MicroBPF:**

| Feature              | seL4 Benefit                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isolation         | Capabilities + separate address spaces = pure sandboxing. Perfect for running untrusted eBPF logic.                                 |
| Minimal           | 10K LOC kernel. No bloat. Ideal for embedded.                                                                                       |
| Formally verified | We can confidently expose APIs to BPF. No weird kernel crashes due to rogue plugins.                                               |
| Policy-as-code    | we could enforce execution limits, syscall limits, memory caps on BPF programs without needing a ‚Äúsecurity module.‚Äù It‚Äôs built in. |

**Risks:**

* We‚Äôll need to build your own:

  * BPF VM or loader
  * ELF loader (if BPF code is compiled separately)
  * Minimal syscall interface
  * Sandboxing engine (or reuse camkes)
* Tooling is mid. we'll probably need to write some Rust/C shims.
* Debugging IPC/Caps = üß† pain.

BUT: **This pain is in the exact area we want to specialize in.** So it‚Äôs worth it.

---

## Option B: Use Zephyr, Tock, or Fuchsia

###  Zephyr:

* Real-time, supported on tons of boards, good driver support.
* Not formally verified. BPF integration is non-trivial.
* Threading model is messy if we want capability-style sandboxing.

### Tock (Rust embedded OS):

* Everything is a capsule. Secure by design.
* No BPF support out of the box. Sandbox model is harder to map to a BPF VM.

### Fuchsia (Google‚Äôs microkernel):

* Super modern. Comes with its own VMO model, Sandboxing, Handles.
* MASSIVE. Not good for low-resource hardware. Not easily portable to tiny IoT boards.

---

## Option C: Build your own kernel from scratch

* It will take **us a year** to match what seL4 gives us in week 1.
* We‚Äôll spend time debugging schedulers and memory paging instead of building BPF logic.
* Fun? Yes. Strategic for MicroBPF? Not yet.

Maybe v3 of MicroBPF, when we know exactly what kernel we want, we write your own.

---

# Now

## 1. **eBPF Integration into seL4**

### What seL4 is Missing:

* No dynamic code execution engine.
* No JIT or interpreter infrastructure.
* No in-kernel programmable logic.

### What We Need to Do:

* **Embed an eBPF interpreter (initially)** into a userspace process with a **capability to perform syscall-like interactions** (safe I/O, memory access, IPC).
* Later phases: Consider building a **minimal in-kernel eBPF VM** that runs inside a separate kernel thread or isolated core (very tricky, see "TCB growth" note below).

### Required Changes:

* Create a **BPF loader** mechanism using seL4 IPC or shared memory from a config agent.
* Write a **verifier** for the subset of eBPF We support (bounded loops, no heap alloc, memory-safe stack-only access).
* Define seL4 **helper syscalls** or capability types that eBPF programs can invoke safely.

---

## 2. **Dynamic Runtime Extensions**

### What seL4 is Missing:

* Kernel is static: no concept of injecting logic post-boot.
* No dynamic reconfiguration model.

### What WE Need to Do:

* Run a privileged **"control plane agent"** in user space that:

  * Loads BPF extensions
  * Configures routing policies or metrics
  * Uses capabilities to communicate with drivers or data-plane agents.

### Required Changes:

* Build a nanopb + protobuf schema parser in userspace.
* Extend seL4‚Äôs bootinfo or IPC setup to include config channels to agents.
* Introduce a **privileged capability class** for agents allowed to inject/update BPF programs.

---

## 3. **Unikernel Deployment + Build System**

### What seL4 is Missing:

* General-purpose apps typically run with CAmkES or custom C startup code.
* Not optimized for **Unikraft-style build pipeline**.

### What We Need to Do:

* Develop a **custom build system (Yocto-style or Nix-style)** to generate:

  * Minimal seL4 kernel
  * Statically linked app with eBPF loader/agents
  * Flattened bootable binary image
* Ensure each deployment links only what is needed.

### Required Changes:

* Fork or modify **CMake/Ninja** flow for seL4.
* Strip unused CAmkES bits or use **libsel4 + libsel4runtime** directly.
* Integrate **LTO, dead code stripping**, and optionally LLVM-based BPF JIT pipeline.

---

## 4. **MicroBPF-Specific Capability Types**

### What seL4 is Missing:

* No semantics for eBPF-safe objects (maps, helpers).
* Capabilities are coarse-grained and static.

### What we Need to Do:

* Define custom capability types for:

  * BPF maps (array, perf counters, ring buffer).
  * Hook points (i.e. "observe this IPC endpoint" or "hook this memory region").

### Required Changes:

* Add new object types to `objecttype.c`, `structures.h`, and object model.
* Extend `deriveCap()`, `provide_cap()` logic for custom cap behaviors.
* Modify `sel4.xml` to expose new syscall interfaces, if needed.

---

## 5. **Boot Time Optimization**

### What seL4 is Missing:

* Base seL4 boots fast, but once we add CAmkES and other init code, it slows down.

### What we Need to Do:

* Use **hand-rolled `init` app**, no CAmkES, no dynamic linking.
* Preload all cap tables and untyped memory pools at compile time (no dynamic allocation).

### Required Changes:

* Use `init_kernel()` as-is, but **customize our root server creation path**.
* Hardcode our "BPF control plane agent" and its memory map into the final image.

---

## 6. **Instrumentation and Observability**

### What seL4 is Missing:

* No kernel metrics, logging, or counters.
* No in-kernel trace points.

### What We Need to Do:

* Add **instrumentation hooks** inside:

  * IPC
  * TCB scheduler
  * Memory faults
* Export these hooks as BPF events, or memory-mapped counters.

### Required Changes:

* Define a new struct in `structures.h` for per-core/per-thread metrics.
* Modify scheduler/IPC code paths to optionally invoke BPF trace helpers.
* Map shared metric regions to privileged userspace (e.g. via `provide_cap()`).

---

## 7. **Optional: Formal Verification for Our Changes**

### What seL4 Already Has:

* Full proof stack (Isabelle/HOL) for vanilla kernel.

### Challenge:

* Any change we make in core seL4 (especially eBPF runtime in-kernel) invalidates existing proofs.

### What we *Could* Do:

* Keep eBPF logic in **userspace** (initially), and limit kernel changes to observable state only.
* Later: Write **separate formal models** of our BPF verifier or sandbox using Coq/Isabelle.

---

## Bonus: Simplified Phased Map

| Phase       | Goal                                | seL4 Impact                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Static unikernel + BPF in userspace | No kernel mods. Custom userspace loader + cap layout    |
| **Phase 2** | Dynamic config + OTA via Protobuf   | IPC-based control agent, minor kernel changes           |
| **Phase 3** | Signed BPF + attestation            | Add capability for attestation agent + cap filtering    |
| **Phase 4** | Verified BPF verifier               | Separate Coq/Isabelle module, or deductive verification |
| **Phase 5** | Distributed RISC-V federation       | seL4 unchanged; build custom comm layer in userland     |

---

## Summary: What we‚Äôre Turning seL4 Into

We‚Äôre evolving seL4 into a **"formally verified kernel substrate"** for an **eBPF-based secure unikernel runtime**:

* Replaces dynamic OS logic with provable, in-kernel scripts.
* Enables hot-swappable behavior in embedded systems.
* Preserves seL4‚Äôs guarantees (if we modularize carefully).

Think: **NixOS meets eBPF meets aerospace-grade OS kernel.**

## System Initialization Flow

The kernel initialization follows a multi-stage process:

<img alt="init" src="/public/sel4/init_flow.png">

### Key Stages

<img alt="mem_mgmnt" src="/public/sel4/boot_mem_management.png">

* **Untyped Memory**
* **Root Server Objects**
* **Memory Regions**

### Memory Structures

  * `addToBitmap()`, `ksReadyQueues[]`, `ksReadyQueuesL1Bitmap`
* **Scheduling Context**

  * `sched_context_t`, `refill_t`, `tcb->tcbSchedContext`

### Functions

| Function            | Purpose                   | Behavior                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `tcbSchedEnqueue()` | Add thread to ready queue | Uses priority-based bitmap indexing |
| `tcbSchedDequeue()` | Remove thread             | Updates bitmap if queue empty       |
| `schedule()`        | Pick next thread          | Highest priority wins               |
| `switchToThread()`  | Context switch            | Architecture-specific               |
