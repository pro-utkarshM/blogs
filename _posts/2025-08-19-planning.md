# 5 Months in Himachal: A Data-Driven Escape  

hi, i’m utkarsh.  

i’m a senior at NIT Hamirpur (yes i spent my 3.5 years in Himachal), studying electronics and communication engineering.  

for the last 3.5 years i’ve been doing what every curious kid does when they realize the world is way bigger than textbooks - building random shit.  

robots, network hacks, microcontrollers, servers, blockchain experiments, kernel code.  
you name it, i’ve probably tinkered with it at 3am.  

but here’s the truth:  
i don’t build *just* because it’s fun.  
i build because i’m scared.  

scared that if the world collapses tomorrow and i somehow survive the chaos, i won’t know how to rebuild it.  
so i’ve been collecting skills like scavengers collect supplies.  
soldering, coding, debugging, reverse engineering - all of it is me trying to prepare for some imaginary apocalypse.  


## curiosity > fear  

somewhere along the way, i realized it’s not just about fear.  
i’m not addicted to “making stuff” for the sake of it.  

it’s curiosity.  

this itch in my head that won’t leave me alone until i poke the system, twist the knobs, break it open and see what’s inside.  

i don’t want to just “use” the world.  
i want to **understand** it. deeply.  


## the next experiment: himachal  

so before i graduate, i’ve decided to do something insane.  

i’m going to spend **5 months traveling across himachal pradesh** - during my last semester, i’ll be taking a remote job and working while i travel.  

not a vacation.  
not some “gap year” spiritual retreat.  
this is an experiment.  

i’ve marked **118 places** i want to explore.  
every village, valley, monastery, mountain pass, river town.  

and i’ve built a system of **18 parameters** - stuff like connectivity, offbeat factor, vibe, difficulty, accessibility, history, chaos energy.  

each place gets an **elo score**.  
like i’m running a chess tournament between mountains and valleys.  


## selection, not checklist  

the catch?  
i’m not going to all 118 places.  

the elo scores + time required will decide which ones make the cut.  
if the top 15 places alone demand 5 months, then so be it.  

the goal isn’t to “check off” everything - it’s to go **deep** where it matters.  

quality over quantity.  
immersion over itinerary.  


## the cost of curiosity  

i did the math.  
this whole experiment - 5 months, all the moving around, food, stays, internet, plus the gear i’ll need - comes to about **4–4.5 lakh**.  

and yeah, i’m including the camera i’ve always wanted to have.  
because if i’m doing this, i want to capture it the way i see it.  

some people might call it “expensive.”  
but to me, this isn’t a trip i’m spending on.  
this is an **investment in myself**.  


## why himachal?  

bc it’s close.  
bc it’s chaotic.  
bc it’s peaceful.  
bc it’s everything at once.  

also bc himachal doesn’t care about my degree, my resume, or the startup ideas in my head.  
it just exists.  

and when you’re surrounded by mountains that have been standing for thousands of years, you start to realize your own noise doesn’t matter.  


## what i want out of this  

honestly? i don’t know.  

maybe i’ll come back with stories.  
maybe i’ll come back with nothing.  

but here’s the thing: for once in my life, i don’t want to optimize for outcomes.  

i want to optimize for **being there**.  
walking through villages.  
talking to strangers.  
journaling at night.  
scoring places like datasets.  

and maybe, in the process, scoring myself.  


## the real test  

college has been projects, deadlines, labs, hackathons.  
this will be the first time i step into something unstructured but still build a system to explore it.  

this is my **field test**.  
a way to see who i am when i remove the scaffolding of assignments, wifi, and comfort.  

maybe i’ll find peace.  
maybe i’ll find chaos.  
but i’m betting i’ll find myself.

### the cost of curiosity  

i did the math.

that’s the plan.  
5 months.  
118 places.  
18 parameters.  
1 himachal.  
1 curious brain trying to map it all.  

see you on the other side.
